### Module Requirements in Python
Astropy 3.0.3
Requests 2.14.2

### Request_LCO
- This module contains a class for requesting observations with the [Las Cumbres Observatories](https://lco.global) network of telescopes.
- The proposal used in this porject only has access to the 0.4m telescopes, therefore this code is specific to those telescopes.

**Example of use:**

### download_data_LCO


**Example of use:**

### AAVSO_get_variables
- The Zooniverse project asks users to circle the variations observed in images taken 5-7 days apart.
- This module searches the AAVSO database using given RA and Dec limits and returns a list of coordinates for the known variable stars in 
that field.
- Circle are drawn around these known variables so that only "new" variables will be highlighted in the Zooniverse project.

**Example of use:**
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

### run_code
