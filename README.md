## AAVSO_get_variables
- The Zooniverse project asks users to circle the variations observed in images taken 5-7 days apart.
- This module searches the AAVSO database using given RA and Dec limits and returns a list of coordinates for the known variable stars in 
that field.
- Circle are drawn around these known variables so that only "new" variables will be highlighted in the Zooniverse project.
